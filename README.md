# UFOs

## Project Overview
We are helping Dana to build a webpage that displays information about UFO sightings using JavaScript along with an HTML index file and CSS style file. The webpage contains a list of UFO sightings with information around each sighting (date, city, state, country, shape, duration and comments). This first iteration of the webpage had a filter to allow the user to select only sightings on a certain date - if no filter was used, all the data is displayed.

We have been tasked with improving the webpage we built together which contained one filter to one that allows users to filter on up to all 5 pieces of information that we have for all sightings.

## Resources

- Sofware: Visual Studio Code
- Language: JavaSript
- Language: HTML
- Library: Bootstrap CSS style

## Results of Filter UFO sightings on multiple creteria
- When you open the original page, you should see all the data unfiltered with the 5 filtered search bars ready for input.

- Finally, if you add on top of the 'Enter Date' filter - which you see we added 'fl', you will see that only 1 was filtered with the same date and state listed.

## Summary

- Once these filters have been added to the website, this allows the users to much more easily analyze the data and get some insight around the topic of UFO sightings.

### Drawback

- One drawback of this webpage is that the dataset we are using is not up to date. 

### Recommendations
- It would be great to add a more recent data that can be searched, and ideally if data was being updated in real-time that would be even better.

- Limitated to North America only right now, and in very heavily weighted to the US. If users from other countries around the world were accessing this webpage, they would like to see information from UFO sightings in their area of the world.

- If we had a feature to be able to seach and filter on key words, ideally in the comments as users may be looking for similar experiences they have heard of or had themselves.
